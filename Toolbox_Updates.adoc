== Introduction
The {itc-shortname} does not intend the PAD toolboxes to be static, and should be updated regularly. This can include new techniques for an existing modality or a completely new modality that has entered the market and has need of validation. This document is intended to provide guidance on how requests for updates should be made to the {itc-shortname}.

This is not intended to provide guidance on questions about the existing toolboxes, such as interpretations or other issues with the requirements which would be handled through the normal Interpretation process. Create a new issue by selecting {iTC-GitHub}/issues/new/choose[Request for Interpretation] for questions of this type.

== Types of Update Requests
There are three categories of update requests as defined by the table.
