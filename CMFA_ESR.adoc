== Status
[NOTE]
====
This section needs to be reviewed
====
The {itc-longname} iTC has been requested by vendors to develop an Essential Security Requirements (ESR) for Continuous Multifactor Authentication (CMFA) products. The CMFA ESR version 1.0 contains material generated by the members of the {itc-shortname}, for a PP-Module to be reviewed by the membership of the {itc-shortname} and endorsed in 2021.

CMFA is an implicit process of validating the user periodically to grant access to the legitimate user and to deny access to impostors based on captured biometric characteristics and built-in sensors of the device and connected devices.

Security requirements in this ESR do not depend on specific biometric characteristics or on particular sensor/connection input.  Therefore the PP-Module that is to be developed based on this ESR does not depend on these characteristics or inputs either. Where possible, it is expected that biometric characteristics used in a product would also be validated to the <<BIOPP-Module>>. The evaluation methodology is defined and described in the supporting document that provides evaluation guidance in common for sensor/connection input and how to combine/manage the various inputs together.

While various PPs (including the <<BIOPP-Module>>) exist related to biometric authentication, the combination of biometrics with additional inputs to generate an authentication outcome has not been defined. The authors of this document agree that the development of a cPP for CMFA shall solely start on the basis of this Essential Security Requirements Document and under consideration of the following objectives:

* The current state of the technology in biometrics in all interested countries shall be considered,
* The developed PP-Module shall be independent of a specific biometric or sensor/connection inputs,
* The developed PP-Module shall be as modular as possible in order to cover all potential application cases.

Accompanying supporting documentation provides specific guidance for each input. CCRA certificates that claim conformance to the PP-Module should be issued only for systems which also utilize biometric characteristics that the CCRA endorsed supporting document covers.

== Background and Purpose
[NOTE]
====
This section needs to be edited
====
From ISO/IEC 2382-37 Information technology — Vocabulary — Part 37: Biometrics (cf. https://www.iso.org/standard/66693.html), we have the following definitions.

Biometric recognition, biometrics:: _automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioural characteristics_

Biometric System:: _system for the purpose of the biometric recognition of individuals based on their behavioural and biological characteristics_

This document describes the high-level set of security requirements that a biometric product shall satisfy when evaluated against the cPP written for such technology.

The biometric product enrols and/or verifies a user using his/her biometric characteristic. Each process is described in the following paragraphs. A biometric product may implement only one of those functionalities.

=== CMFA Enrolment
The enrolment process for CMFA is likely to encompass multiple steps, covering both user and administrator actions. The user may provide biometric data (or select already-registered data to be used), or select external devices to use as sensor input. The administrator may provide configuration information such as acceptable Wi-Fi networks, time settings, location data or specific sensors to be used. This combination of information provided by the user and administrator would be used to enrol a user for CMFA.

=== Biometric verification
[NOTE]
====
This section needs to be updated (I have not touched it at all)
====
During the verification process the user provides his/her identity and biometric characteristic to the biometric product. The biometric product retrieves the biometric template associated with the identity from the database, compares it with the biometric feature extracted from the captured biometric characteristic of the user to generate the similarity between the two data, and determines whether user is accepted or rejected based on the similarity.

Examples of modalities used by biometric recognition systems are: fingerprint, face, iris, palm print, finger vein, palm vein, speech, signature and so forth. The following figure, inspired from ISO/IEC JTC1 SC37 standards, is a generic representation of a biometric system (other configurations exist). This illustrates the different sub-functionalities on which the biometric enrollment and the biometric verification processes rely on.

.Biometrics System Example

When used in a security system, the biometric product needs to take into account the risk of subverting the biometric functionalities. One of the main entry points for an attacker is the biometric capture subsystem where they could present artificial or abnormal biometric traits at the point of presentation and collection of the relevant biometric characteristics, in order to interfere with system policy. As defined in [30107-1], this corresponds to a presentation attack, the “presentation to the biometric data capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric system”. It can be realized by presenting an artefact or human characteristic which are called presentation attack instruments. Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) refers to the automatic determination of a presentation attack. The PAD subsystem plays an important role in the security of biometric systems, especially when unsupervised.

[30107-1] ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016. Information technology -- Biometric presentation attack detection -- Part 1: Framework

== Use Case(s)
CMFA products are used primarily for user authentication for mobile devices such as smartphones, where the authentication can be used to unlock the mobile device. This status can also be provided to external services such as a PC login at the office, building or room entrance control or ATMs.

The first version of the PP-Module focuses on the use case that the CMFA product is used for unlocking the mobile device. Additional PP-Modules have to be created for other use cases. 

== Resources to be protected
* _Any asset that enrolled users can access after successful verification_
* _CMFA features, configuration data, templates and security related parameters, such as the threshold values, that are used and referenced for CMFA verification_

== Attacker access
* _An attacker can present some set biometric characteristics and sensor/connection input and try to be incorrectly verified as a genuine user._
* _[An attacker may present any kind of presentation attack instruments during enrolment and verification for the sake of impersonation.]_
* _[An attacker may try to spoof sensor/connection input during enrolment and verification for the sake of impersonation.]_

_Normal Italicized text indicates attacker access related to Essential Security Requirements and (Italicized text within square parenthesis) indicate ones related to Optional Extensions._

== Attacker Resources
* _Any resources allowed to be used by the basic attack potential to examine and attack the CMFA product_
* _Commercially and/or publicly available software/knowledge/equipment, and, if it is commercially available, samples of the CMFA product to test and attack_

== Boundary of Device
[NOTE]
====
Not exactly sure how to phrase the boundary
====
* _The hardware, firmware, software and security functionalities of the CMFA product define the boundary_
* _All of the security functionalities are contained and executed within the boundary of the CMFA product_

_An example of a CMFA boundary within the overall context of the inputs used for authentication is shown below._



.Example CMFA Boundary
image::toe-boundary.png[width=80%,align="center"]

* The purple boundary is the CMFA TOE, including the CMFA Engine, the CMFA Signal Verification and the Admin interface
** CMFA Engine is the core of system, determining the authentication outcomes
** CMFA Signal Verification is used to ensure trust of the incoming sensor/connection input (Yellow boxes)
** Admin is the component that received configuration data from the external management service (such as an EMM)
* The orange Biometric Sensors & PAD are for any dedicated biometric sensors (such as face, fingerprint or vein) that are used for input that meets (or has been validated to) the requirements of the Biometrics PP-Module. A biometrics sensor that does not could be considered a yellow sensor.
* The yellow sensors/connection input can cover any type of input that may be used. For example the type of Wi-Fi connection, location data, time or wearable device connectivity. 

The different color lines are used to show an example of paths and the level of trust that is associated with the input.

* Black lines show "internal" communications between components
* Green lines show highly trusted input (trust established both by the source and the path to the TOE) that can be trusted fully without additional checks (and hence is input directly to the CMFA Engine)
* Red lines show less trusted input that must be checked before being used
* Yellow, dashed lines show potential alternative paths for sources (generally for sources that may be normally considered highly trusted but which may want to be separately verified anyway)

== Essential Security Requirements
* _The CMFA product shall enrol users and create templates of sufficient quality_
* _The CMFA product shall use inputs of sufficient quality and verify users less than claimed error rates (i.e. FAR and FRR)_
* _The CMFA product shall protect CMFA data in cooperation with its operating environment_
* _The CMFA product shall provide a defined value or configuration for the meaning of Continuous (i.e. a frequency of the verification)_

== Assumptions
* _Admin configures the CMFA product and its environment correctly in a manner to ensure that the security policies will be enforced_
* _The environment provides an alternative authentication mechanism as a complement to CMFA verification_
[INFO]
====
I'm not sure how to handle this requirement. I have a PAD component listed, which for example, would be something like determining what type of Wi-Fi network you are connected to (i.e. open vs EAP-TLS), but I don't know how much more can/should be done, so I haven't edited the assumption below
====
* _The biometric product is assumed to be used in a controlled and observable environment (i.e. presentation attack can be considered non practical, however, presentation attack can be addressed by optional extension if needed)_

== Optional Extensions
[NOTE]
====
I'm not sure if we would actually even include this here technically. This in the BIO is for say Face PAD, but CMFA is built from multiple components. So would PAD be on the whole combined CMFA, or should it be on the inputs? I don't know that there would be any way to have CMFA PAD as a whole today, and I think we should focus on input PAD for individual components (maybe there is a better term to use over PAD, like CMFA TI for CMFA Trust Input or something).
====
Requirements captured in this section may already be realized in some products in this technology class, but this ESR is not mandating these capabilities exist in “baseline” level products.

* _The biometric product shall prevent enrolment nor verification from being successful when presentation attack instruments are used_

== Outside the Scope of Evaluation
* _Biometric identification_
* _Sensor/connection input connections_
* _Management interface (i.e. the server)_
